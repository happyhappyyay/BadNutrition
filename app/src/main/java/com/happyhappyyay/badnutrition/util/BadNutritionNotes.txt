Calendar: Locale Monday/Sunday first day
typo at androidx.compose.ui.window AndroidDialog.android.kt Dialog
typo at java.lang.IllegalStateException: Horizontally scrollable component was measured with an infinity maximum width constraints, which is disallowed. One of the common reasons is nesting layouts like LazyRow and Row(Modifier.horizontalScroll()). If you want to add a header before the list of items please add a header as a separate item() before the main items() inside the LazyRow scope. There are could be other reasons

In-Progress:
    Concepts:
        Brand:  name - nutrition story?

        Card View: fun form?-apple fills for goal %
        Categories for foods?
        Select nutrient items to change graph on food distribution?
        list all dates/partitions for a specific food
        compare foods/nutrient days long click
        streaks for x days in a row meeting goal x?
        conversions for all available measurement units in util && add a combined food datum w/ measurements
        add multiple dates and date range picker to calendar
           long click activation?
        up arrow to quickly move to top of lists
        matching colors to graph bars - design of color integration styles.jpg in ./Pictures
        modularize graph components
        color of food item corresponding to nutrient that is largest (%?)
        set add food button default selection
        gestures for swiping away filter and closing ItemSelector screen?
        Add favorite-ing to foods
        Replace sorting items not nutrient
        Option for self-Created foods? filter?
        for food percent dv and total nutrient for time (e.g., nut- calcium 5% / 19%)?
        extend click space to the text next to the bar?

    Advised:
            Mimic Food label order for macro/micro nutrients as default
                similar breakdown for food -> nutrients
            Add additional coloring for bars 0-25%R,25-75%Y,75-100%G

    Current:
    Dates off by 1
    settings for graph
        SubComposeLayout for nested dropdown box (expanded dropdowntop subocomposelayout else text )
        Add information to food list
    Future:
            UI StateHolder for add filter
            Sanitize add food inputs
            Graph on food items change with different item selection

Images
    Spiral with an apple hanging from it?
        graph legend corners
    Inset Apple into book? or Sheet?
        logo
        tree with apple hanging (garden of eden or newton?)
    Selected item based on fruit ( selected circle for graph )
        Apple - red
        Banana - yellow
        Orange - orange
        Lime - green
        Cookie/Coconut/Potato - brown
        Blueberry - blue
        Eggplant - purple
        Onion - white
        Blackberry - black



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Graph Options:
        Bar
        Line
        Scatter?
choose  food item(s) (all, selection of items, one item, PARTITION)
in      time span (all, day, week, month, year or custom range)
            by increment (day, week, month, year)
in      partition (all, breakfast, partition2, dinner, partition3...)
           !!! how many times did i eat how many meals did i have!!!
with    nutrient(s) (all, selection of items, or one item)
as         % (1%, 2%, 3%...)
or as      measured value (1mg, 2mg, 3mg...)
or with occurrences
as         exists (0% or 100%)
or as      entries (1 ,2 ,3...)
or as      servings (1, 2, 3...)
when multiple items: average(mean), sum, most frequent(mode), minimum, maximum, averaged difference
include/exclude    empty entries(no data-all 0s), range - [upper bound x, lower bound y]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Style
    Nouns/ adjective + nouns for composables
    rememberName for remembered items
    PascalCase for constants despite kotlin convention
    modifier passed only to top level element
        only one modifier
    Column/Row saves all data as opposed to lazy versions
